#This is the code book for the project

##How to get to the TidyData.txt:

Download data from the link below and unzip it into working directory of R Studio.
Execute the R script.
About the source data
The source data are from the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set. A full description is available from the website:
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones 
Here are the data for the project:

About R script
The "run_analysis.R" performs the 5 following steps based on the requirements of the project:

# 1.Reading in the files and merging the training and the test sets to create one data set.
1.1 Reading files including:
-Reading trainings tables
-Reading training label
-Reading training subjects
-Reading testing tables
-Reading testing label
-Reading testing subjects
-Reading features
-Reading activity labels
1.2 Assigning variable names
1.3 Merging all data in one set
The first thing in the project to do is to create a uniform data set out of the by have three datasets for the training data, training 
subject mand its corresponding labels, and thress datasets for the test data, test subject and its corresponding labels
# 2. Extracting only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
2.1 Reading variable names
2.2 Create vector for defining ID, mean and standard deviation
2.3 Making nessesary subset from merged data set
# 3. Using descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
# 4. Appropriately labeling the data set with descriptive variable names
# 5. Creating a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
5.1 Making second tidy data set
5.2 Writing second tidy data set in txt file
The code assumes all the data is present in the same folder, un-compressed and without names altered.

About variables:
train_data, train_label, train_subject, test_data, test_label, and test_subject contain the data from the downloaded files.
train_total, test_total and sub_data merge the previous datasets to further analysis.
